VLSI Portfolio

A collection of VLSI projects designed and simulated using Verilog and Surfer. This repository showcases my practical experience in digital design and hardware circuits.

Repository Structure
	•	combinational/ – Verilog code for combinational circuits (adders, multiplexers, decoders, etc.)
	•	tb/ – Testbenches to verify circuit functionality
	•	waveforms/ – Simulation waveforms from Surfer corresponding to the testbenches

Tools Used
	•	Verilog – Digital circuit design
	•	Surfer – Simulation and waveform visualization
